## Individual Contributions
Earnestina Petergeorge - Testing, figuring out a bankers algorithm, helped with figuring out a code for the algorithm, readInput,safe_state()

Gulnar Saharya - Makefile, implementing code for receiving file, main function,readFile, executed, matrix_p, run_thread, 

Mostly collaborated as a team for all
